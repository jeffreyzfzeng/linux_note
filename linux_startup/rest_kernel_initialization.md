# rest kernel initialization

`start_kernel` calls `rest_init`, at this point things are almost all working. `rest_init` creates a kernel thread passing function `kernel_init` as the entry point. `rest_init` calls `schedule` to kickstart task scheduling and go to sleep by calling `cpu_idle`,  which is the idle thread for the Linux kernel. cpu_idle() runs forever and so does process zero, which hosts it. Whenever there is work to do ¨C a runnable process ¨C process zero gets booted out of the CPU, only to return when no runnable processes are available.
