# grub\_load\_normal\_mode

We come to the last routine invoked in `grub_main`, before loading normal mode module, let's first check all loaded modules now, because more grub modules will be loaded in order to load it. `print_all_modules` is a function added in gdb script.

```c
(gdb) print_all_modules 
$1 = 0x7ff8fd0 "search_fs_uuid"
$2 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x7ff8977
$3 = 0x7ffa0a0 "biosdisk"
$4 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x7ff9929
$5 = 0x7ffa920 "part_msdos"
$6 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x7ffa558
$7 = 0x7ffbe30 "ext2"
$8 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x7ffb629
$9 = 0x7ffc990 "fshelp"
$10 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x0
```

# _load normal mode module_

`grub_load_normal_mode` invokes `grub_dl_load` with module name `normal` to load the module.

`grub_dl_load` gets directory of modules located:

```c
  "(hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub"
```

get the accurate path of normal module:

```c
  "(hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod"
```

load the module file with routine `grub_dl_load_file`, after procedure of `grub_dl_load_file`completed, normal module loaded completed.

```c
grub-core/kern/dl.c:704

/* Load a module using a symbolic name.  */
grub_dl_t
grub_dl_load (const char *name)
{
  char *filename;
  grub_dl_t mod;
  const char *grub_dl_dir = grub_env_get ("prefix");
(gdb) p grub_dl_dir
$11 = 0x7ff8030 "(hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub"

  mod = grub_dl_get (name);
  if (mod)
gdb) p mod
$12 = (grub_dl_t) 0x0
    return mod;

  ......

  filename = grub_xasprintf ("%s/" GRUB_TARGET_CPU "-" GRUB_PLATFORM "/%s.mod",
                             grub_dl_dir, name);
  if (! filename)
(gdb) p filename
$14 = 0x7ff7f20 "(hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod"
    return 0;

  mod = grub_dl_load_file (filename);
(gdb) p mod
$15 = (grub_dl_t) 0x7ff7ee0
  grub_free (filename);

  ......
}
```

Now let's check all loaded modules again, not only normal modules, but also some others for example `boot, extcmd, crypto, terminal, gettext, gzio`  were loaded as well.

```c
(gdb) print_all_modules 
$17 = 0x7ff7ec0 "normal"
$18 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x7f06c68
$19 = 0x7f02bf0 "gzio"
$20 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x7f00199
$21 = 0x7ff30d0 "gettext"
$22 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x7ff2692
$23 = 0x7ff42c0 "terminal"
$24 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x7ff39c6
$25 = 0x7ff5c50 "crypto"
$26 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x0
$27 = 0x7ff70a0 "extcmd"
$28 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x0
$29 = 0x7ff7d50 "boot"
$30 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x7ff77ca
$31 = 0x7ff8fd0 "search_fs_uuid"
$32 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x7ff8977
$33 = 0x7ffa0a0 "biosdisk"
$34 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x7ff9929
$35 = 0x7ffa920 "part_msdos"
$36 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x7ffa558
$37 = 0x7ffbe30 "ext2"
$38 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x7ffb629
$39 = 0x7ffc990 "fshelp"
$40 = (void (*)(struct grub_dl *)) 0x0
```

# _about procedure of loading a module from the file FILENAME_

In order to make clear why so many new modules loaded, let's go back to routine `grub_dl_load_file`.

`grub_dl_load_file` opens normal mode module on disk with `grub_file_open`.

```c
grub-core/kern/dl.c:662

/* Load a module from the file FILENAME.  */
grub_dl_t
grub_dl_load_file (const char *filename)
{

  ......

  file = grub_file_open (filename);
  if (! file)
    return 0;

  ......
  
}
```

`grub_file_open` divides device name and file name first

```c
grub-core/kern/file.c:70

  device_name = grub_file_get_device_name (name);
  if (grub_errno)
    goto fail;

  /* Get the file part of NAME.  */
  file_name = (name[0] == '(') ? grub_strchr (name, ')') : NULL;
  if (file_name)
    file_name++;
  else
    file_name = (char *) name;

```

opens device with `grub_device_open`

```c
grub-core/kern/file.c:81

  device = grub_device_open (device_name);
  grub_free (device_name);
  if (! device)
    goto fail;
```
